# Student-Profile-Tracker

Problem statement:
To develop a system called Student performance tracker using which one can view a
student's academic performance. Another goal was to provide edit privileges only to certain types
of accounts while the rest were barred from performing these actions. The whole system is to be
defined such that students/faculty will be able to use the system through a graphical user
interface(GUI).
To achieve all of these targets and to help us develop the back end(code that executes our
actions) and the front end( GUI) we used IntelliJ IDEA. IntelliJ IDEA is a Java integrated
development environment (IDE) for developing computer software, which is developed by
JetBrains.
